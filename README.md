# Traffic-Accident-Severity-Prediction
This project aims to predict the severity of road accidents based on various factors such as vehicle speed, crash time, driver demographics, road conditions, and crash type. The dataset includes detailed accident records, and the goal is to build a ML model that classifies accidents into different severity levels (e.g., Fatal, Serious, Minor).
